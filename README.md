## 🚀 How do I use this repo for practice?
The repo contains:
- Multiple individual project folders.
- Category folders (e.g., buttons/, flags/, etc.).

Though each project folder follows this same structure:
```
Archery Target/
├── preview/   → Contains a visual reference:
│    ├── preview.png/jpeg (for static layouts)
│    └── preview.gif/mp4  (for animated/dynamic layouts)
├── starter/   → This is where you’ll code. Starter HTML + assets are here.
├── solution/  → Full completed solution for reference.
```
### 🧪 Suggested Workflow:
1. **Open a project folder** of your choice.
2. Look at the preview (*.png, .gif, or .mp4*) to get a visual understanding about the layout you need to implement.
3. Go into the **starter** folder:
- open projectName.html.
- read any notes or comments.
- use the provided assets (images, fonts, etc.) given in the sperate folder.
- start coding the layout using only HTML + CSS.

Once done, compare your solution with the **solution/ folder**.
